This site is mainly filled with ~content I random walked during my Phd. So welcome to Nahom's meanderings. My most interesting stops where at the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG), Dynamical Cluster Methods (DCA, DMFT) and the Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) so if you happened upon this site via the Oracles at Google welcome. The code for the projects is freely available somewhere.

If you were more direct in your search, on top of being a person I am computational Physics PhD at Boston University. I mostly study methods for solving problems of correlated electrons with a focus on making a general solver driven mainly by the Functional Renormalization Group. Easy to use packages for solving single orbital systems in up to two dimensions should be up on my Github. Some of my old talks and research is also strewn about so pardon the mess. Welcome!!!
